# Nvidia-Water-project
The trained model.pth file and data sets are too large to upload under the current git file size restrictions, however please see my code developed to train the model. This project was aimed at classifying water clearity within a glass of water, trained from a variety of image smaples with a range of clean to dirty water. First, run the code in the first cell to activate the camera. The camera is used to collect images that are used as input for the trained model. The next cell creates the task of the algorithm and defines the categories of data. For this, I assinged the task of water evaluation, termed 'Water', and catagories of 'Water_Clean" and "Water_Dirty". The data location folder is defined for the Image Clasification Dataset as "Water_A" that contains the labelled images separated into two folders "Water_Clean" and "Water_Ditry". Next, is the Data Collection cell, this being code used to establish a process for migrating camera generated inputs and track counts by category. The Model cell describes code related to model training. This uses torch, an open-source library for deep/machine learning. The model selected is a resnet18, in this case being used to classify images that contain either a clean or dirty glass of water. Code in the same cell provides buttons that ask the user to load a model and save a trained model. train and load a model. The Live Execution cell activates the connected camera to provide a live feed of new images for the model to train from. Training and evaluation, this cell looks at the datasets and then tests itself by comparing the imgages and hypothozizing if the water is clean or not and seeing if it is correct. The second last cell is simply used to display all the code and the live feed. When the code is running you should see widgets and the live feed of your camera. Becuase the model couldnt be be uploaded you will need to create your own by adding how many epochs you want it to run and then press train. after that save the model and then load it. Finnaly press live and you should be getting live feed and if you hold up a glass of water twards your camera there will be a prediction if it is either clean or dirty water. The last cell is simply for turning off your camera and exit the code.
